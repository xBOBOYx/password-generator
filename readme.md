PASSWORD GENERATOR


Description:

In this assignment we had to create a password generator that created a random string of characters, lowercase letters, uppercase letters and numbers.
I went through several different version of this and ended up with the code you see here. This will randomize an array then print after the criteria 
is selected by the user. In another version that I was working on, I was using char codes to represent the arrays instead of actually typing out the 
array. That is still a work in progress. I went with this one becuase it was closer to what we learned before the homework. Below you will find the 
acceptance criteria for the assignment. 

This one was a challenge, but at the end of the assignment I had a better understanding of what is actually happening in the code. Looking forward 
to our next assignemts. 

## User Story
